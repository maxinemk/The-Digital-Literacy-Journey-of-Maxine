        <h2>Social Networking and Entertainment</h2>


        <p> Technology rapidly changed and morphed from my childhood, and technology primarily started as a means to entertainment and connection.
            I started with the games built into the PC desktop computer like Pinball Wizard, and then moved onto installable games like Mavis Beacon and Bernstein Bears. 
            As I neared middle school, MySpace ruled supreme among the middle school kids, and quickly I learned the tricks to make a cute profile with a hidden music player,
            alongside MySpace, we would share YouTube videos and follow popular content creators. Pre-fall, I now maintain a Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to keep in connection
            with friends at home and abroad. 
        </p>

        <p>These programs and games all teach users basic skills that carry over into the next biggest thing, 
            each new phone, moving from a phone with buttons to a touch screen, navigating Facebook vs MySpace, optional tutorials on a new PC or gaming system. 
            Each of these new technologies follow a pattern or have an easy intro and explore option. 
        </p>

        <p>As for the future of my personal use, I imagine wearables will become more advanced and I'll need to explore the possibilities of what they may replace
            I also think that there will always be a new and shiny social media tool and I will need to pivot then, too. 
            These are all things I really enjoy learning about and tinkering with new technology, so I hope I won't be the grandmother who is very confused with anything new.  
        </p>

        <h2>Educational Uses</h2>

        <p>I previously mentioned Mavis Beacon typing game; Education has driven a lot of my digital literacy.
            The technical dimensions of writing that I have utilized most as a requirement of my education are Microsoft Office Suite and Email. 
            I would consider them as digital composing tools. 
        </p>

        <p>Every writing assignment after being taught how to type  has utilized Microsoft word,
            in the beginning we would have to write everything on paper and then bring it to class where 
            we would have a computer lab day to type it out with teacher help before printing it in class.  
            Then we were expected to have the tool of a computer at home, where we would type it in Microsoft Word and print the
            document to turn in the assignment.
            Most recently, it has been expected that I write it at home in word, save it as a pdf, and then email it or upload it onto an academic learning software. 
            Word was the most utilized part of the Office Suite, but similar patterns were established with PowerPoint. 
        </p>

        <p>Email became the primary form of communication with my instructors and fellow students when I started college.
            I didn't see email as very hard to learn to utilize because the interface seems straightforward: draft email, create a subject title,
            address to person/people, press send. Because social media rose in my formative years, I prefer keeping my email communication educational/professional,
            and do not utilize it personally among friends or family. 
        </p>

        <p>Other tools I have used for my current Technical Writing Certificate courses are the Adobe Suite tools of Illustrator, Publisher, and InDesign.
            These tools make projects more creative, and are more difficult to use because they do not have the rigid, built-in formatting of Microsoft Office Tools.
            These are tools that I still only have a basic understanding of, and hope to continue developing for other areas of my life and career. 
        </p>

        <p>For the future of my digital literacy, other than maintaining and mastering the tools mentioned above,
            I know that my course <i>"Writing with Digital Technologies"</i> would give me more basics in Coding HTML and CSS, 
            as well as structured authoring with XML and DITA XML. These are all things I have lightly researched,
            but I have not taken much time to master any of these technologies in the past. 
            I hope to master the basics and transfer this knowledge base into my career digital literacy skills. 
        </p>

        <h2>Career</h2>

        <p>In my past I have worked many different positions with varying digital literacy requirements,
            but in my current position I feel that I have been given challenges to overcome in how I learn.
            In the past, every tool I had used was a widely used tool among many companies, institutions, and homes. 
            Those types of tools have many official and unofficial guides that are easy to find and get your questions answered. 
            For example, incorporating Google Drive/Suite into my daily work life was not a stretch, since I had been using gmail products for my education use for so long. 
            What I did need to adjust to in my literacy, is etiquette in professional emails, and collaborative document writing.
        </p>

        <p>For collaborative document writing, the measure of literacy is not only using the tools, 
            but changing you color or look of your font so that others know it was you who made the edit, not writing over but adding to a colleague's idea, 
            and keeping track of previous versions etc.  In professional emails, it was adjusting to what your closing signature looks like, writing concisely without seeming curt,
            and when to use BCC over CC. I wonder how much of that is social literacy over digital, but it has been important in my development.
        </p>

        <p>In my current position working with student data at the Carlson Global Institute,
            I was not able to start my actual duties until I completed many in person and online training created by University of Minnesota and PeopleSoft technicians.
            These step by step videos and general pdfs applied to only traditional students studying domestically in the U.S. I had to come to terms with the fact that if
            I needed answers that I would need to directly contact and find university employees to assist me. Until this point,
            I always followed the "How To" documents and videos provided, and figured the rest out for my self via context clues and google searches. 
            Since I work with Global programs, many of our needs are square peg to round hole, and I've worked with various offices to find workarounds in a rigid system.
            The inflexibility of PeopleSoft in my work led me to my interest in technical communications because I started creating process documents to explain to coworkers
            how to utilize the software in the most efficient way to get our information correctly into the system. 
        </p>

        <p>In all, I think there are basic digital literacies the are increasingly required in the workplace,
             but it is hard to define and Peoplesoft and Google Drive are only two of the many random tools that have come my way in working at
             a University that always strives to improve itself. For the future of my career's digital literacy, I imagine this will not be my last position with specialized software,
             but I do hope I have a hand in selecting new specialized software that work best for the needs. 
             I think that with this educational program that I have already learned how to distill the bulk of information into clear use cases,
             and am able to detail it to leadership who does not work much with new technologies as well as IT Teams who work with it and know programs better than I.
